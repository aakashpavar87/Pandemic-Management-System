        <h1>Employee Benefits</h1>
        <div class="benefit-content">
            <p>Protocol Zone’s vast array of benefits support our colleagues and their families in many areas of their lives — from their health, to work/life balance to community engagement. We take a holistic approach to support our team’s overall energy and vitality.</p>
            
            <h2>Generous Health and Wellness Benefits</h2>
            <p>The company offers competitive and comprehensive medical, dental, and vision plans for employees, their spouses, domestic partners, and dependent children. We offer a generous sick leave policy so colleagues can take time off to recover from an injury or illness or care for family members who are unwell. Additionally, Protocol Zone employees can avail themselves to a robust suite of wellness opportunities, such as support for new parents, paid family leave, and an annually employer-funded account that supports a healthy lifestyle.</p>
            <p>We also believe in supporting the mental health of our colleagues and offer generous mental health support options and coverage through our medical plan. We encourage our team members to take advantage of the broad set of mental health resources, such as a 24/7 employee assistance program, mindfulness tools, online coaches, mental health webinars, and a number of mental health apps.</p>
